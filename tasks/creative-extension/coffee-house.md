### ☕ Coffee-House: Creative Extension

Welcome to the **final stage** of your Coffee-House project — the time to unleash your creativity, technical curiosity, and problem-solving skills!

In this part, you have **2 weeks** to design and implement your own **unique feature or improvement** to the Coffee-House app. This is your chance to go beyond the given requirements and show initiative as a developer.

#### 🎯 Your task

Choose and implement **one or more** enhancements that demonstrate your creativity and ability to explore new technologies or improve the existing solution.

You can:

🧩 **Add a new feature** — loyalty system, product reviews, favorite drinks, dark/light theme switcher, etc.

⚙️ **Integrate a tool or technology** — implement ESLint rules, Husky pre-commit hooks, unit tests, or CI/CD with GitHub Actions.

🚀 **Migrate the project to a framework** — for example, rebuild it with React, Vue, or Angular (if you feel ready!).

🗄️ **Enhance the back-end** — add new endpoints, improve error handling, or extend the existing API.

🧠 **Implement performance or UX improvements** — lazy loading, accessibility features, or better mobile interactions.

🌍 **Add localization** — support for multiple languages and user settings.

💳 **Add payment simulation** or an order tracking page.

📈 **Create an admin dashboard** for managing products or orders.

✨ **Anything else that reflects your creativity and technical growth!**

🧑‍🏫 Presentation & Interview

At the end of the task, you’ll present your project to your mentor.
Prepare a short presentation (5–10 minutes) where you:

Explain your idea and what motivated you to choose it;

Demonstrate how it works;

Briefly describe the technologies, tools, or approaches you used;

Share challenges you faced and how you solved them.

Be ready for your mentor to ask technical questions about your work — to understand how deeply you grasped the topic.

#### 🏆 Evaluation

❗️ **Please note:** The presentation of your feature will be a part of the technical interview with your mentor. After the interview, you will receive two separate score:

- **Creative Extension** — for your idea, implementation quality, and presentation.

- **Technical Interview** — for your understanding of the project, technologies, and general front-end knowledge.

#### 💡 **Tips for Success**

- Choose something that excites you — your enthusiasm will make your work shine!
- Manage your time — plan your work so you have time for testing and polishing.
- Don’t be afraid to explore — this is your safe space to experiment and learn.
- Make your project visually appealing and technically solid.

Enjoy this final creative journey and make your Coffee-House truly your own! ☕✨
