# CV. HTML, CSS & Git Basics

Your task is to create a branch named `rsschool-cv-html` from the `gh-pages` branch of the `rsschool-cv` repository, 
add files `index.html` and `style.css` to it, which contain basic empty templates or templates with minimal content 
(the layout and styling of the CV will be done in the next task), and deploy them to GitHub Pages.


## Some of the validation rules:

- Extra spaces at the end of lines are not allowed.
- A closing tag or closing slash for a non-pair tag is not allowed.
- If you use characters `<`, `>`, `&`, etc., they must be replaced with escape sequences.

All errors found by the validator during the checking of your work are listed in the `Details` section of the results table.

## Workflow

1. Continue working in the `rsschool-cv` repository created during the previous task [Markdown & Git](git-markdown.md).
2. Create a branch `rsschool-cv-html` from the `gh-pages` branch.
3. Maintain a commit history during the project. Follow the [commit guideline](https://docs.rs.school/#/en/git-convention), where the name of each commit should start with one of the specified prefixes: `init:`, `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`.
4. In the `rsschool-cv-html` branch, place the files `index.html` and `style.css`, adding basic empty templates or templates with minimal content to them. The actual CV layout and styling will be done in the next task.
5. In the `README.md` file of the `rsschool-cv-html` branch, add a link like `https://GITHUB-USERNAME.github.io/rsschool-cv/`, replacing `GITHUB-USERNAME` with your GitHub username. This link will open the CV page as a fully styled webpage. We will add the actual layout during the next task.
6. Create a Pull Request from the `rsschool-cv-html` branch to the `gh-pages` branch. The title of the Pull Request should be `HTML, CSS & Git Basics`. Follow the [Pull Request description template](https://docs.rs.school/#/en/pull-request-review-process?id=Требования-к-pull-request-pr). Merge the Pull Request from the `rsschool-cv-html` branch to the `gh-pages` branch.
